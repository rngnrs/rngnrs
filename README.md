Welcome, stranger.

No graphs, no badges, no fluff.  
I’m an *engineer*, not a *programmer*. No tech job, no star-chasing.

## About

I code what I must because I can.  
Crafting an imageboard engine — privately for now, in my own timeline.  
Not for you, not with you. It’ll surface somewhere, somewhen, but (not) here.

## Stance

Value’s in the deeds, not the spotlight.  
I’m not here to impress you, baka.

## Contact

Ping me at `sup at tumba d0t ch` if you dare. Don’t wait for a reply; there is no cake.
